# Workshop overview

## About this Workshop

Time series is a series of data points that is indexed overtime. The goal of time series mdoels is describe and predict the pattern of the data as it changes over time

In this workshop, you will first provision an Oracle Data Science Notebook session and upload SP500 data either through a local file upload. You will then go ahead and build the model, with detailed explanations and instructions throughout the entire Data Science lifecycle. Upon completion, you will analyze the results of your model and deploy the model to OCI Model Catalog.

This lab is the second part of the Time Series livelab. Please makre sure to complete that lab before starting this one.

Estimated workshop time: 60 minutes (this includes all the labs in this workshop)

### Objectives

In this workshop you will:
* Get a high level overview on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and the architecture for DS/ML
* Learn how to train ML models for Prophet Forecasting
* Learn to use OCI Data Science
* Learn how to integrate ML into an application (operationalize your results)

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
* Additional prerequisites (cloud services) are mentioned per lab

## Product Overview

You will be introduced to Oracle Cloud and gain a high level overview of the products involved in Data Science and Machine Learning. You will learn at a high level about OCI Data Science, Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse and OCI Object Storage.
